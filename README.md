# flexLand
The Odin Project - Landing Page 

This project is a part of the Odin Project's Foundations Course for Flexbox. 

This is a simple project where the goal is to reproduce a web page provided to 
the student. The point of the project is to show working knowledge of Flexbox
principles rather than copying the design verbatim.
